It's a simple method that check if a `package-name` is installed with the `Intent` on Android. Similar to `Share.open` and `Share.single` this method will return a `Promise`, which will be fulfilled when the native code successfully check for the application.

Using a promise implementation:

```js
Share.isPackageInstalled('com.instagram.android')
  .then((response) => {
    console.log(response);
    // { isInstalled: true/false, message: 'Package is Installed' }
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.log(error);
    // { error }
  });
```

Or with `async/await`:

```js
const checkPackage = async () => {
  const { isInstalled } = await Share.isPackageInstalled('com.instagram.android');
}
```

Keep in mind, that similar to `Share.open` and `Share.single` it's a good idea using a `try/catch` whenever a call to this method is requested.

For iOS you can use the `Linking.canOpenURL(instagram://)` where the `url` is the app scheme that you want to check. Also, note that calling the `isPackageInstalled` on iOS will return a `Error: Not implemented`.
