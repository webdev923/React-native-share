If you are using `react-native >= 0.60` you just need to do a simple:

```shell
yarn add react-native-share
```

Or if are using npm:


```shell
npm i react-native-share --save
```

After that, we need to install the dependencies to use the project on iOS(you can skip this part, if you are using this on Android).

Now run a simple: `npx pod-install` or `cd ios && pod install`. After that, you should be able to use the library on both Platforms, iOS and Android. 

Also, to use this library on iOS you will need:

* XCode 11 or higher
* iOS 13 SDK or higher

After that, you will see that the library is now available at your `node_modules`.

## Manual Linking

If the auto-linking doesn't work for any reason, you can still run a:

```shell
react-native link react-native-share
```

## Manual Install

### iOS Install

1. `yarn add react-native-share`
2. In XCode, in the project navigator, right click `Libraries` ➜ `Add Files to [your project's name]`
3. Go to `node_modules` ➜ `react-native-share` ➜ `ios` and add `RNShare.xcodeproj`
4. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `libRNShare.a` to your project's `Build Phases` ➜ `Link Binary With Libraries`
5. In XCode, in the project navigator, select your project. Add `Social.framework` and `MessageUI.framework` to your project's `General` ➜ `Linked Frameworks and Libraries`
6. Run your project (`Cmd+R`)

### Android Install

1. `yarn add react-native-share`
2. Open up `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainApplication.java`
    - Add `import cl.json.RNSharePackage;` and `import cl.json.ShareApplication;` to the imports at the top of the file
    - Add `new RNSharePackage()` to the list returned by the `getPackages()` method

3. Append the following lines to `android/settings.gradle`:
  	```
  	include ':react-native-share'
  	project(':react-native-share').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, 	'../node_modules/react-native-share/android')
  	```
4. Insert the following lines inside the dependencies block in
   `android/app/build.gradle`:

    ```
      implementation project(':react-native-share')
    ```
5. **(Optional)** [Follow this for implementing Provider](#adding-your-implementation-of-fileprovider)

### Windows Install

[Read it! :D](https://github.com/ReactWindows/react-native)

1. `yarn add react-native-share`
2. In Visual Studio add the `RNShare.sln` in `node_modules/react-native-share/windows/RNShare.sln` folder to their solution, reference from their app.
2. Open up your `MainPage.cs` app
  - Add `using Cl.Json.RNShare;` to the usings at the top of the file
  - Add `new RNSharePackage()` to the `List<IReactPackage>` returned by the `Packages` method

### Adding your implementation of FileProvider

Follow this to implement your `FileProvider`. If you have any doubt please you found more about that [here](https://developer.android.com/training/secure-file-sharing/setup-sharing.html)

- `applicationId` should be defined in the `defaultConfig` section in your `android/app/build.gradle`:

- File: `android/app/build.gradle`

    ```
    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.yourcompany.yourappname"
        ...
    }
    ```

- Add this `<provider>` section to your `AndroidManifest.xml`

    File: `AndroidManifest.xml`
    ```xml
    <application>
        <provider
            android:name="androidx.core.content.FileProvider"
            android:authorities="${applicationId}.provider"
            android:grantUriPermissions="true"
            android:exported="false">
            <meta-data
                android:name="android.support.FILE_PROVIDER_PATHS"
                android:resource="@xml/filepaths" />
        </provider>
    </application>
    ```

- Create a `filepaths.xml` under this directory: `android/app/src/main/res/xml`.

    In this file, add the following contents: 
    
    File: `android/app/src/main/res/xml/filepaths.xml`
    
    ```xml
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
    <paths xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android">
      <external-cache-path name="myexternalimages" path="Download/" />
    </paths>
    ```

- Edit your `MainApplication.java` class to add `implements ShareApplication` and `getFileProviderAuthority`
- The `getFileProviderAuthority` function returns the `android:authorities` value added in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file
- `applicationId` is defined in the `defaultConfig` section of your `android/app/build.gradle` and referenced using `BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID`

    ```java
    import cl.json.ShareApplication
    public class MainApplication extends Application implements ShareApplication, ReactApplication {

         @Override
         public String getFileProviderAuthority() {
                return BuildConfig.APPLICATION_ID + ".provider";
         }

         // ...Your own code

    }
    ```

## Older versions

If you need to use a older version of `react-native < 0.60`, then you will need to run a:

```shell
yarn add react-native-share@version
```

Or with npm:

```shell
npm i react-native-share@version --save
```

You can look at all versions, that we published [here](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-share/releases).


## react-native 0.59.10 

If you can't update your project to the most recent version of both react-native and react-native-share, please use `1.2.1`. Alternatively you can use [jetifier](https://github.com/mikehardy/jetifier#to-reverse-jetify--convert-node_modules-dependencies-to-support-libraries) running a ```npx jetify -r```.
